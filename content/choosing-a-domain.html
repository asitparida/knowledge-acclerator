            <h1>Goal</h1>
            <p>In our first “real” sprint, our goals revolved around first deciding on a domain, and then mapping the terrain of our domain (ultimately online shopping) after the group collectively decided on this as our domain of focus.</p>

            <h3>Research report synthesized from insights</h3>
            <p>Initially, our group thought it would be best to determine which categories of online sensemaking to focus on based on interviews with experts (e.g. business professor experienced in e-commerce). After discussing our plans with the client, we decided instead that a general survey to determine what people actually looked at would be more advantageous. We also conducted directed storytelling sessions to gain more in-depth insights. The research report helped us to synthesize the findings from these two methods into broader insights that could be presented to the client. </p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>In our first post-kickoff sprint, our project had somewhat of an unexpected start. Before having the official kickoff with the client, the most that any of our group knew about the project was what was given to us over winter break in the form of the project descriptions. Based on the prompt, our group assumed that the aim of the project was to explore sensemaking and how to accelerate cold starts in research, specifically within the domain of online shopping. In the course of the kickoff, we were told that the project didn’t necessarily need to focus on shopping as a domain, and that if we as a team thought that another area would better suit our interests (albeit still working toward the same knowledge and sensemaking goals), that we would be free to change tack.</p>
            <p>Thus, the plans we had originally made exclusively focused on shopping and trying to delineate which areas within shopping would provide most fruitful, were instead replaced by methods to help our team determine which domain we wanted to pursue. Our group felt that a widespread survey aimed at elucidating which of these domains were most popular and deserved a closer look would be the best way to accomplish this. We would then take the next week to conduct more in-depth user interviews with respondents who indicated an interest in helping the project further, in the hopes that the deeper insights would provide more context and assist in the narrowing down process.</p>
            <p>Our survey revolved around five distinct domains: shopping, travel, health & wellness, job hunting, and event planning. The survey asked people what they researched and how and where that research happened. The survey was answered by 241 people, with the largest percentage of respondents favoring shopping as the domain they did the most research (36.1%). We also found that only a small number of users were actually doing intensive research (“super-optimizers”), or creating artifacts as a part of their research, something the client was specifically interested in. Nonetheless, we were energized that our initial feelings about moving forward with shopping as a domain were validated and jumped into user studies to learn even more about the domains.</p>
            <p>Due to the small percentage of users from the survey who were interested in being interviewed further about their online research behavior, our group did not go through with the initial plan of choosing two users from each of the five domains. Instead, we focused on the most popular domains (shopping and travel) to try and find generalizations about the use of these tools. After conducting 11 interviews, our team got a little more clarity about the use of tools online, finding that more people used tools for travel purposes than shopping; users tended to use familiar tools, rather than searching for new ones (Google tools featured heavily); and that more intense purchases warranted deeper searching and artifact creation. After reviewing the results from the survey and the user studies, we also decided as a team to remain with shopping as a domain. It seemed to be more difficult to find users to study in other domains, and it appeared as though we would be able to find sufficient data to draw conclusions within shopping due to its popularity.</p>
            <p>We ended the sprint excited by the information we were finally starting to get about research behavior, the crystallization of our idea of the three different types of research personas, and our collective decision to remain with shopping as a research domain. However, there were still some trepidations about whether shopping was the right domain (there was evidence suggesting a dearth of research artifact creation), and whether or not we were actually researching sensemaking online. These questions would have to wait until Sprint 2 to be answered!</p>
