            <p>The team felt the need to narrow further and move into tangible concepts that could evoke more meaningful
                and directed feedback appropriate to the stage of the process. The ideas tested until now provided
                insightful discussions into the mindset of what people valued as helpful when researching online.

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>The sprint started with our synthesis of the feedback from our storyboarding sessions. It was clear that
                our <strong>participants preferred a form of visual aid</strong> over any text-heavy solution with some sort of agency.
                The team noted that the arcs of storyboards reflected broad concepts and hence, we broke down the same
                into insights. We posited features from these insights and bucketed them into must-haves and
                good-to-haves. The next step was to combine traits into comprehensive solution sketches. The level of
                data fidelity was also increased in the illustrations so that we could test more tangible solutions.</p>
            <p>The ideas in the new comprehensive solution-sketches ranged from cards containing definitions to journey
                map and from talking to a friend to reaching out to experts. We speed-dated the sketches with 10-12
                participants iteratively. The insights from these sessions pointed to how structures and definitions
                would undoubtedly <strong>help people better translate their mental models</strong>. People liked the idea of being able
                to compare product specs across different platforms. Having scaffolding supports resonated with people
                who had trouble looking where to start.</p>

            <p>Until this, we had stressed the idea of focussing on consumers in the entirety of the Spring semester
                with the plan being to figure out what artifacts people wanted first and then focus on how to get our
                motivated creators into creating content in those forms. We had structured our process to answer the
                following in sequence - </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What types of artifacts do people want to consume in the space of online shopping sensemaking?</li>
                <li>How do we guide creators to build the right artifacts for consumption?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on the insights we got from the user testing sessions, the team felt the need to look for a
                different group of users who would have intrinsic motivation to collect and synthesize information in a
                structured way and create and share content among them and others. We knew that the essence of
                sensemaking had the most relevance in the domain of academic journal research. So we looked to find a
            <strong>similar group of people who were equally passionate</strong> about collecting-synthesizing-artifacts.</p>

            <p class="caption">Identifying features for contributors, fans, and novices who are part of communities</p>
            <p>The deliberations led us to reframe our user groups as passion communities. Engaged in focused activities
                like comic book fandom, environment-friendly activities, water conservation, hiking, fashion, and makeup
                bloggers, etc., these groups consist of individuals who share a common interest. This drives their
            <strong>strong and sustained motivation</strong> for content creation and consumption. In fact, for them, these are not
                two distinct activities but the same. We focused on the current active creators - Bloggers, YouTubers,
                Quora/Reddit active contributors. We conducted four user interviews with active contributors to Zhihu (a
                Chinese site similar to Quora) and learned about their current behaviors. </p>
            <p>With this refined target user group, we wanted to <strong>understand their habits</strong> around collecting information,
                thought processes when organizing them, and the tools they currently use.

                    sensemaking process, at least, not in that specific order. </li>
