            <p>We created process journeys to synthesize findings from our initial round of research because these
                helped us create a shared understanding of the current state between our team and the client. We also
                drew specific pain points from each journey and used those as seeds for our first-round ideation, which
                were later turned into storyboards so that we can validate the needs of users and explore possible
                design orientations.</p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>After affinitizing findings from user interviews about online shopping behavior, we found that our
                previous assumption that there are different types of shoppers (e.g. Super-optimizers, information
                gatherers, and satisfiers) wasn’t supported by the research. It is rarely the case that a user exhibits
                the same pattern of researching for information when shopping. In fact, we found that the processes
                people go through when shopping for something vary depending on a multitude of factors --
                importance/value of the purchase, prior knowledge about the domain, time available, number of viable
                options, etc.. Therefore, instead of shopper personas and their research style, we decided to make
                process journeys that capture the steps people take and the pain points they encounter during the
                shopping research process.</p>
            <p>Through our collected data, we developed three archetypes that captured the majority of the processes --
                iterative, linear, and condensed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>The linear model is a straightforward process characterized by a single round of research, followed by
                contextualization (how does this product fit into my life), then a decision & potential subsequent
                purchase.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <p>The iterative process is a bit more complicated: information gathering and contextualization happens more
                than once in a looping pattern. Eventually this leads to a decision and purchase, but this process may
                yet be repeated again if the purchase turns out to be unsatisfactory. </p>

        <div class="container">
            <p>There was also a shorter, condensed model identified: the user goes into shopping process already having
                contextualization, which abbreviates the process.</p>
            <p>We identified some factors for why people would exhibit one behavior or another when shopping, which
                include (but aren’t limited to): the importance or value of the purchase; prior knowledge about the
                domain; time available; and number of viable options. </p>
            <p>These behavior models and their associated pain points helped to identify some general design
                opportunities going into our ideation phase, which included: collapsing the foraging and
                contextualization process (i.e. allowing people to see both more information about a product as well as
                how it could fit into their specific situation simultaneously, instead of sequentially); providing
                indication of the research progress; and better translating the intent into a specific search.</p>

                We selected five broad concepts to test with users in order to validate if the pain points we identified
                and possible solution directions resonated, using storyboards to test our hypotheses with representative
                users.We found that in general, <strong>people expected a tool that helps with both information
                    gathering and decision making, rather than one that helps with only one or the other.</strong> More
                specific insights include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>People want others’ opinions, but need to know more about their identity in order to validate the
                    authenticity of the information.</li>
                <li>People want to have agency in their shopping decision making process. </li>
                <li>People found visual solutions to be more appealing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although some aspects of the design ideas resonated with the participants, none of them seemed to stand
                out as absolutely indispensable. Regardless, they were informative and helped us scaffold our design
                ideas going forward. We took these findings and used them to hone our ideation process to further
                discover and validate user needs.</p>
