            <p>Having a specific scenario/user would inform us of the design directions and solid opportunity to design for
                the target
                user. By creating a story, we can build empathy with external stakeholders as well. Also, an early stage
                prototype
                would guide our first step of transforming the ideas into forms. It can provide early feedback that
                saves time and
                cost by validating our assumptions and establishing a common understanding of the design guidelines and

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>Before starting the prototype, we first divided up the possible user groups into contributors, fans, and
                novice
                users to clearly address their differences in their needs and use cases. We listed out the potential
                features that
                can help address the user needs and voted on the features that would best align with our research
                findings.
                After discussion, our team decided to pursue and test further on providing templates and sharing the
                created them
                within the contributors’ online community.</p>
            <p>Based on the given features, we created a specific scenario of an active contributor on Youtube who wants
                to organize cosmetic products and share the artifacts. This allowed us to reveal the particular
                features with rationale and gave us more insights into how we would visualize our solutions.
                Likewise, we transformed our research insights into pain points and needs of the contributors, and also
                from pain points to high-level design guidelines:
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy integration with the already existing platform </li>
                    <li>Interactive transitioning between foraging and organizing </li>
                    <li>Easy sharing of both information and template</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Early stage prototype would guide our first step of transforming the ideas into forms. We also wanted to
                intentionally incorporate our assumptions into our design as a way to test our hypotheses and clarify
                with the target user in a more realistic, feasible way. After low-fi prototyping, we created a list of
                questions for each feature and pages to test with the user. For user testing, we first observed how
                people are already researching to create artifacts, and then went through our prototype to get both
                high-level and detailed feedback. On the other hand, the user testing findings solidified our potential
                target user and further questions to validate throughout prototyping.</p>

            <p>We started to draft our spring presentation. Through faculty feedback and internal discussion, we
                formatted for each sprint in the form of: design questions/challenge, process, and insights. We also tried
                to weave stories to make the abstract concepts and research process into a more digestible presentation.
                As part of the spring capstone presentation, we wanted to present a low-fi prototype as an open-ended
                solution that we would present as our final challenge but using low-fi as a way to further to test and
                iterate in the summer. </p>
            <p>Moving forward, we want to further investigate our user and test our prototype. The two high-level
                questions we have are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How can we design a product that aligns with the current behavior of the contributor?</li>
                <li>How might we incorporate collaborative elements?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To answer these key questions, we need to conduct further focused research, user testing with
                our prototypes, and iterate with contributors. Ultimately, our ideal product by the end of the summer is
                to create a generalizable tool that can support contributors in multiple online communities.</p>
