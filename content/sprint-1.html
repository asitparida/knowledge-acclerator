            <p>The survey allowed us to get a broad understanding of the landscape of online research; the literature
                review was
                important from an academic standpoint to better understand our client’s background; and the directed
                storytelling
                was critical to start empathizing and understanding users. The research report helped us to synthesize
                the findings
                from our survey, literature review and interviews into broader insights that could be presented to the
                client. </p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>In our first post-kickoff sprint, our project had somewhat of an unexpected start. Before having the
                official
                kickoff with the client, the most that any of our group knew about the project was what was given to us
                over winter
                break in the form of the project descriptions. Based on the prompt, our group assumed that the aim of
                the project
                was to explore sensemaking and how to accelerate cold starts in research, specifically within the domain
                of online
                shopping. In the course of the kickoff, we were told that the project didn’t necessarily need to focus
                on shopping
                as a domain, and that if we as a team thought that another area would better suit our interests (albeit
                still
                working toward the same knowledge and sensemaking goals), that we would be free to change.</p>
            <p>Thus, the plans we had originally made exclusively focused on shopping and trying to delineate which
                areas within
                shopping would provide most fruitful were instead replaced by methods to help our team determine which
                domain we
                wanted to pursue. Our group felt that a broad survey aimed at elucidating which of these domains were
                most commonly
                looked at within online research would be helpful.</p>
            <p>Our survey revolved around five distinct domains: shopping, travel, health & wellness, job hunting, and
                event
                planning. The survey asked people what they researched and how and where that research happened. The
                survey was
                answered by 241 people, with the largest percentage of respondents favoring shopping as the domain they
                did the most
                research (36.1%). We also found that only a small number of users were actually doing intensive research
                (“super-optimizers”), or creating artifacts as a part of their research, something the client was
                specifically
                interested in. Nonetheless, we were energized that our initial feelings about moving forward with
                shopping as a
                domain were validated and jumped into user interviews to learn even more about motivations behind online
                research.</p>
            <p>We focused on the most common domains for online research (shopping and travel) to understand more about
                motivation
                behind online research and the journey taken. We utilized directed storytelling to gain further insights
                from users.
                After conducting 11 interviews, our team got more clarity about the use of tools online in researching,
                finding that
                more people used tools for travel purposes than shopping; users tended to use familiar tools, rather
                than searching
                for new ones (Google tools featured heavily); and that more intense purchases warranted deeper searching
                and
                artifact creation.</p>
            <p>Based on our all findings, we synthesized the data to pull out key insights into a research report. We
                also
                leveraged the literature review completed in the previous sprint to bolster our credibility with our
                client, given
                the client team has been researching this space for over 10 years. We found some interesting insights
                related to
                three key stages of online research that we found: information gathering, synthesis and decision-making.
                With
                information gathering, we learned that people used established curation features, like “best seller”
                flags, to make
                the process of gathering information much more condensed. We also learned that during information
                synthesis,
                collaboration is much more common in travel than shopping. Finally, we learned that when people make
                decisions, they
                largely rely on reviews & ratings to make decisions quickly and the process of deciding is not a
                collaborative one.
                However, our survey had indicated that shopping was the most common online research domain. We had
                learned in our
                client kickoff that Knowledge Accelerator’s primary goal was to build a “generalist” tool. Because we
                wanted to
                build a tool that ultimately was for this “generalist”, online shopping was where we wanted to focus our
                time and
                that’s how we continued to narrow to our next key question.</p>
            <p>We ended the sprint excited by the information we were finally starting to get about research behavior
                and our
                collective decision to remain with shopping as a research domain.</p>
