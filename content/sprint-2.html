            <h3>Affinity diagram from interpretation notes</h3>
            <p>We wanted to evaluate different patterns of behavior for foraging, synthesizing and decision phases of
                shopping
                sensemaking, which we felt an affinity diagram would assist with. The diagram would also allow us to
                identify
                breakdowns and possible design opportunities found across research for further explorations</p>

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>We began the sprint by trying to map out the landscape of online shopping. The survey conducted hinted
                that people
                behaved differently when shopping online, and we were interested in elucidating these different
                behaviors. Based on
                our initial observations, and guided by suggestions from Niki, we had three inchoate online shopping
                types which we
                sought to explore with in-depth interviews. These types were: satisficers, or someone who does not need
                to do
                extensive research online to make a purchase; optimizers, or someone who is willing to do some research
                (within
                reason) in order to get a better purchase; and super-optimizers, or those who spend an outsized amount
                of time and
                are the primary creators of artifacts in the space.</p>
            <p>We conducted interviews with 18 users about their recent electronic product purchases. Initially, we were
                going to
                divide our interviews evenly between the three shopper types; ultimately, we decided to interview any
                users who had
                recently purchased an electronic product because we weren't able to draw clear lines among those three
                user groups.
                We chose to focus on purchases within the electronics domain because these are usually larger purchases
                which our
                preliminary research identified as having longer processes of online information gathering and
                sensemaking. In this
                way, we could better identify pain points through these processes.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/sprint-2/IMG_4275.JPG" />
            <p>We used the data from this round and the previous two rounds of interviews to discover commonalities
                among online
                shoppers, as well as pain points that could identify further research or design opportunities. We were
                able to find
                patterns such as
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I buy stuff because I want to improve the current lifestyle</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I  want to go through the process with minimal time</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>My research intensity depends on how much knowledge I have</p>
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                Through those small patterns,
                we were able to generate higher insights such as "research is just a way to reach my goal". After we finished the affinity diagram, we discovered these five main insights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Research is just a way to reach my goal</li>
                <li> I adjust my research process depending on constraints</li>
                <li>I rely on trustworthy/official platforms</li>
                <li> I think something could be optimized for me</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our next research steps were guided by the overarching insight that validation and contextualization of
                information
                online are primary friction points across all behavior models. We also were eager to use the data from
                interviews to
                map out different models for online shopping to guide our future designs.</p>
