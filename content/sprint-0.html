            <h3>Team Contract & Client Presentation</h3>
            <p>By putting team goals, expectations, best practices and non-negotiables into a document,
                it forced the team to talk about all of these areas explicitly upfront. We were able to each raise our
                own ideas of
                what "done" deliverables look like, what communication methods are acceptable depending on the scenario
                and what our
                goals were for this team and this project. The team contract became the foundational cornerstone on
                which we
                launched our activities for the next several months, including our first critical client interaction.

            <h1>Process</h1>
            <p>Each team member came to our initial team meeting with individual ideas of goals and best practices, both
                for the
                team and for ourselves.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/team-culture/team-culture-01.jpg" />
            <p>We codified team expectations and team culture, including communication methods, roles and
                responsibilities. After
                building our foundational building blocks for team culture through discussion of goals, best practices
                and
                accountability, we put our words into action through our first team task: background research for our
                project.</p>

            <p>The entire space of online sensemaking was completely new to us, so we had a lot of ground to cover. We
                did several
                iterations of background research, starting with discovering anything and everything we could learn
                about online
                sensemaking, our clients, online shopping, machine learning and crowdsourcing - the key components of
                our project
                description. The space was nebulous and overwhelming, but by using communication and accountability
                standards we had
                established for our team, we were able to work together to build a shared understanding of the space.

            <p>The culmination of two weeks' worth of teamwork, diving deeply together in a space we knew little about
                with a team dynamic we had just defined, was our “kickoff meeting”. This meeting allowed us to present
                our team understanding of the project space to our client and discuss meaningful critical questions
                about the project with the client to shape our direction for the next 3 months.</p>
            <p>Through our initial background research and our set team expectations, we started diving deeper into the
                problem space to understand our domain.</p>
